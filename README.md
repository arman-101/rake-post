## Details
- Deployed online at - https://rake-27719.web.app/
- Wanted to create a basic posting app, similar to my [Full Stack Web App](https://github.com/arman-101/posting-full-stack-web) where a backend was created with a database, all which added a lot of complexity, so I tried using Firebase for the database and it works!
- Used: React + Bootstrap + Firebase

## Running locally
- Git clone / Download Zip
- install dependencies - `npm install`
- run server - `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
